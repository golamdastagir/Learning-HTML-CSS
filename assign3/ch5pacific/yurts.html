        yurt is fully enclosed with canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a roof
        dome that can be opened

        Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and
        gas-fired storve. Your luxury camping experience includes electricity
        and a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower and restroom

      <dd>
        Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for
        changung weather with light layers of clothing. It's also helpful to
        bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!
