      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <h3>
        In 1974 Dr Paul Lam, a family physician from Sydney Australia, took up
        tai chi to control his arthritis. Tai chi helped him overcome his
        condition, it also improved every aspect of his life. Dr Lam has created
        a series of Tai Chi for Health programs and produced instructional
        materials to make tai chi easy and enjoyable to learn. Through his
        privately owned company, Tai Chi Productions, his team have produced
        many best-selling titles worldwide.<br />

        In 2013, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and National
        Council on Ageing recommended Dr Lams program. Many governmental
        departments around the world endorse them. One of the most sought after
        teachers, Dr Lam must be the first in history to have travelled over a
        million miles teaching tai chi.<br />

        There are over eight million people around the world who have enjoyed
        and benefited from Dr Lams Tai Chi for Health programs.<br />

        The Tai Chi for Health Institute was founded in 2010 by Dr Lam and many
        of his Tai Chi for Health colleagues with the purpose of empowering
        people to improve health and wellness through the Tai Chi for Health
        programs. Also to monitor the quality and standards of the training and
        to provide support for instructors. It is a non-profit organisation
        registered in Australia and governed by a democratically elected
        board.<br />

        Both organisations have the same purpose and naturally there is close
        collaboration to save resources. That does not compromise either
        organisations independence. Dr Lam is committed to supporting the Tai
        Chi for Health vision and has always personally offered significant
        discounts to instructors of the program through Tai Chi Productions.
