            Chen, Yang, Wu, Wu (different words in Chinese) and Sun. Each style
            has its own features, but all styles share the same essential
            principles.<br /><br />

            The essential principles include mind integrated with the body;
            control of movements and breathing; generating internal energy,
            mindfulness, song (loosening) and jing (serenity). The ultimate
            purpose of tai chi is cultivate the qi or life energy within us to
            flow smoothly and powerfully throughout the body. Total harmony of
            the inner and outer self comes from the integration of mind and

          <h2>Just what is Tai Chi?</h2>
          <h3>
            There is much more to tai chi than one can see, and virtually no one
            can describe such a complex art in one simple sentence. Yes, it's
            aesthetically pleasing, easy and enjoyable to practice. It can be a
            meditation and an integral exercise for all parts of the body and
            the mind. It brings tranquility and helps you think more clearly.
            Tai chi can be many things for different people; regular practice
            will bring better health and wellness.<br />

            The flowing movements of tai chi contain much inner strength, like
            water flowing in a river, beneath the tranquil surface there is a
            current with immense power-the power for healing and wellness. With
            consistent practice, people will be able to feel the internal energy
            (qi), convert it to internal force (jing) and use it to generate
            more internal energy. This process would greatly enhance tai chi
            development, leading to a more balanced mental state; at the same
            time your fitness, agility and balance will improve. The unique
            feature of tai chi is that it is internal. Internal means building
            the inner strength from inside out, therefore you can continue to
            develop at any age.<br />

            Numerous studies have shown tai chi improves muscular strength,
            flexibility, fitness, improve immunity, relieve pain and improve
            quality of life. Muscle strength is important for supporting and
            protecting joints and is essential for normal physical function.
            Flexibility exercises enable people to move more easily, and
            facilitate circulation of body fluid and blood, which enhance
            healing. Fitness is important for overall functioning of the heart,
            lungs, and muscles. In addition to these components, tai chi
            movements emphasize weight transference to improve balance and
            prevent falls.
